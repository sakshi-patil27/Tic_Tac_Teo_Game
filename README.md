Java Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Java. It's a two-player game where players take turns to place their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.


How to Play
1) The game board is a 3x3 grid, and each cell is identified by its row and column numbers.
2) Players take turns entering their moves. Each move consists of specifying the row and column where the player wants to place their symbol.
3) The game will display the updated board after each move.
4) The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If no player achieves this and all cells are filled, the game is a draw.
5) At the end of each game, you'll be prompted to play again or exit the game.
